# ðŸ”¥ One Line LLM Tuner ðŸ”¥

Fine-tune any Large Language Model (LLM) available on [Hugging Face](https://www.huggingface.co) in a single line.

## Overview

`one-line-llm-tuner` is a Python package designed to simplify the process of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2, Llama-2, GPT-3 and more. With just one line of code, you can fine-tune a pre-trained model to your specific dataset. Consider it as a wrapper for `transformers` library, just like how `keras` is for `tensorflow`.

## Features

- **Simple**: Fine-tune models with minimal code.
- **Supports Popular LLMs**: Works with models from the `transformers` library, including GPT, BERT, and more.
- **Customizable**: Advanced users can customize the fine-tuning process with additional parameters.

## Installation

You can install `one-line-llm-tuner` using pip:

```bash
pip install one-line-llm-tuner
```

## Usage

The PyPI package can be used in the following way after installation.

```bash
from one_line_llm_tuner.tuner import llm_tuner

fine_tune_obj = llm_tuner.FineTuneModel()

fine_tune_obj.fine_tune_model(input_file_path="train.txt")

fine_tune_obj.predict_text("Elon musk founded Spacex in ")
```

If you want to modify the default values such as type of model used, tokenizer and more, use the following code.

```bash
from one_line_llm_tuner.tuner import llm_tuner

fine_tune_obj = llm_tuner.FineTuneModel(model_name="gpt2",
                 test_size=0.3,
                 training_dataset_filename="train_dataset.txt",
                 testing_dataset_filename="test_dataset.txt",
                 tokenizer_truncate=True,
                 tokenizer_padding=True,
                 output_dir="./results",
                 num_train_epochs=2,
                 logging_steps=500,
                 save_steps=500,
                 per_device_train_batch_size=128,
                 per_device_eval_batch_size=128,
                 max_output_length=100,
                 num_return_sequences=1,
                 skip_special_tokens=True,)

fine_tune_obj.fine_tune_model(input_file_path="train.txt")

fine_tune_obj.predict_text("Elon musk founded Spacex in ")
```
